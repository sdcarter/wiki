## Why wiki.carterissmarter.com?

This project is born of a desire for my own to publicly collect my various tools, thoughts, projects and information into an easily accessible and searchable space. What follows is a collection of whatever is in my brain that myself and perhaps others may \(or may not\) find useful. I don't presume that it's meaningful for many or even any, but if it helps turn on someone to something they didn't know about before, all the best

## Implementation Details

This wiki is built using a combination of [GitHub](https://www.github.com) & [GitBook](httsp://www.gitbook.com). I generally do all my work directly in the text editor and commit, which is then synced to GitHub on each push. If you would like to see the repository that this is derived from, you can visit [my project wiki repository](https://www.github.com/sdcarter/wiki).
